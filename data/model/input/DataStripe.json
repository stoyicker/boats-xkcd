We generated video signals with a cathode ray tube... We have a pointing device we call a \"mouse\"... I can \"copy\" text... ... and we have powerful join file editing... underneath the file here we can exchange \"direct messages\"...\n\n[[Douglas continues to narrate. Some music is playing.]]\nDouglas: ... Users can share files... ... files which can encode audio samples, using our \"masking codecs\"... The file you're hearing now is one of my own compositions...\nMusic: I heard there was a secret chord\n\n[[Douglas continues to narrate.]]\nDouglas: ...

This cat is saying \"YOLO\", which stands for \"You Only Live Once\"... ...Just a little acronym we thought up...\n\n{{Title text: Actual quote from The Demo: '... an advantage of being online is that it keeps track of who you are and what you\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099re doing all the time ...'}}",
